'Pre-hab' involves strengthening your body *before* the operation, which has been shown to improve surgical outcomes and speed up recovery. Post-operative rehabilitation is then essential to safely restore range of motion, rebuild strength, and guide you back to full function. We work closely with your surgeon's protocols to ensure a smooth and effective healing journey."
